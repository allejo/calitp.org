    - "Adding a contactless payment reader to a bus or train means customers can quickly
      and easily tap to pay as they board with the bank card or smartphone that’s already
      in their pocket—just like they’d tap to buy a coffee."
    - "Starting with <a class='text-white' href='https://mst.org/news_items/monterey-salinas-transit-announces-launch-of-contactless-fare-payment-demonstration' rel='noreferrer'
      target='_blank'>Monterey-Salinas Transit</a>, Cal-ITP and partners like Visa
      demonstrated how a transit provider that has traditionally used cash and agency-specific
      fare cards can accept contactless bank card payments like any other merchant. "

    - "Cal-ITP is helping transit providers remove the guesswork for riders wondering
      when the next bus or train will arrive or if they’ll make their connection by
      using the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)—the global standard for publishing
      transit information. Cal-ITP developed <a class='text-white' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp/california-minimum-general-transit-feed-specification-gtfs-guidelines'>California
      Minimum GTFS Guidelines</a> and is working to ensure statewide GTFS schedule/static
      coverage and GTFS Realtime. The Cal-ITP team will support transit providers by
      assessing their systems and providing technical assistance so riders can easily
      access complete, accurate, consistent, and timely mobility data for their journey."
