        The California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP) is working with transit agencies across the state (and country!) to
        promote a modern and consistent transportation experience throughout California. Each and every transit agency in the
        state can become a Cal-ITP customer. We provide free technical assistance and support to help agencies implement
        Contactless Payments, Transit Benefits, GTFS and more.

          The Ventura County Transportation Commission (VCTC) supports several transit agencies in greater Ventura County and
          manages two. With a goal of unifying and modernizing transit in their region, VCTC partnered with Cal-ITP. They wanted
          to pilot scheduling software that could help them adjust existing routes, plan for the addition of electric vehicles,
          make quick and efficient schedule changes, and export high-quality GTFS (as required by the National Transit Database).
          In addition, Cal-ITP helped VCTC to better understand integrations between their technology vendors, to work to
          implement open loop payments on their VCTC Intercity service and to identify opportunities to streamline GTFS processes.

        <h3>Monterey-Salinas Transit</h3>
        <ul class="mt-3 ps-4">
          <li>Fleet size: 88</li>
          <li>Services operated: fixed-route, paratransit</li>
          <li>
            Goals:
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce cash dependency</li>
              <li>Implement contactless payments for all riders</li>
              <li>Streamline eligibility verification for discounts</li>
              <li>Improve connectivity in rural areas</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3 text-body-tertiary">
          After implementing contactless payments, Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) needed a way to help their riders quickly and
          easily access transit benefits and discounts. They wanted a minimalist, seamless solution. They wanted riders to be able
          to use their benefits without downloading a new app or device.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-body-tertiary">
          Cal-ITP partnered with MST to review existing fare policies, including for federally required groups like veterans and
          older adults. MST implemented Cal-ITP Benefits, an automated process which allows riders to link their transit discount
          to their card for contactless payment. Digitally verifying identification reduced the burden on the customer service
          team at MST, who previously processed all applications by hand.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-body-tertiary">
          In 2022, MST became the first transit agency in the nation to provide an automated method for Senior Citizen Discounts
          via an open-loop contactless payment system. In the past year, 200% more riders have tapped to pay and received their
          discounted fare automatically!
