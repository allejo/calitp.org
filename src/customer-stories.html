            The Ventura County Transportation Commission (VCTC) supports several transit agencies in greater Ventura County and
            manages two. With a goal of unifying and modernizing transit in their region, VCTC partnered with Cal-ITP. They wanted
            to pilot scheduling software that could help them adjust existing routes, plan for the addition of electric vehicles,
            make quick and efficient schedule changes, and export high-quality GTFS (as required by the National Transit
            Database). In addition, Cal-ITP helped VCTC to better understand integrations between their technology vendors, to
            work to implement open loop payments on their VCTC Intercity service and to identify opportunities to streamline GTFS
            processes.

          <p class="mt-3 text-body-tertiary">
            After implementing contactless payments, Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) needed a way to help their riders quickly and
            easily access transit benefits and discounts. They wanted a minimalist, seamless solution. They wanted riders to be
            able to use their benefits without downloading a new app or device.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-body-tertiary">
            Cal-ITP partnered with MST to review existing fare policies, including for federally required groups like veterans and
            older adults. MST implemented Cal-ITP Benefits, an automated process which allows riders to link their transit
            discount to their card for contactless payment. Digitally verifying identification reduced the burden on the customer
            service team at MST, who previously processed all applications by hand.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-body-tertiary">
            In 2022, MST became the first transit agency in the nation to provide an automated method for Senior Citizen Discounts
            via an open-loop contactless payment system. In the past year, 200% more riders have tapped to pay and received their
            discounted fare automatically!
