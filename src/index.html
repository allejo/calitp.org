    <p>
      There are hundreds of public transit providers in California—with no consistent way to collect fares, verify eligibility for
      fare discounts, or provide real-time vehicle information to customers on their phones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of a consistent experience creates barriers for new customers, complicates travel across different systems, and
      increases expenses for individual providers.
