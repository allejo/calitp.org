        <h3>Enabling contactless payments</h3>
        <p>
          Adding a contactless payment reader to a bus or train means customers can quickly and easily tap to pay as they board
          with the bank card or smartphone that’s already in their pocket—just like they’d tap to buy a coffee.

            target="_blank">Monterey-Salinas Transit</a>, Cal-ITP and partners like Visa are demonstrating how a transit provider that has traditionally used cash and

        </p>
        <p>
          And to make it easier and more affordable for public transportation providers anywhere in the U.S. to acquire the
          building blocks of contactless payments, the California Department of General Services (DGS)—in collaboration with Cal-ITP—conducted a Request for Proposal that established Master Service Agreements (MSAs) allowing public transportation providers to purchase contactless payments hardware and software directly from vendors without further competitive bidding.
